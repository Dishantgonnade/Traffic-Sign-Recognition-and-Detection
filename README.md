# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-and-Detection

"Traffic Sign Recognition and Detection" refers to a project aimed at developing algorithms and systems capable of identifying and interpreting traffic signs in images or video streams. The project typically involves utilizing computer vision techniques such as image processing, machine learning, and deep learning to detect and recognize various types of traffic signs, including speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and more. The primary goal is to enhance road safety by enabling vehicles or intelligent transportation systems to automatically interpret and respond to traffic signs accurately in real-time. This project demonstrates proficiency in computer vision, machine learning, and potentially robotics, making it a valuable addition to a resume, especially for roles related to autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, or image processing.
